# ecs-hours-api
An Node.js application that fires data via email through an endpoint

## About
This application serves the static files of the [front](https://github.com/brdppl/ecs-hours "front") built in Angular 10 and the endpoint that triggers the sending of data email

## Inspiration
Tired of manually sending weekly timetable emails, I developed this application to automate the process
